Create and application within the Xamarin.Forms framework, and include all  of these features:

      1.  Provide an interface for all  the following information for as many academic terms as needed:

            •   academic term title (e.g., Term 1, Term 2, Spring term)

            •   start and end dates (use a DatePicker)

      2.  Provide an interface that allows the user to access all the following features for each academic term:

            •   add and display a list of six courses for each term

            •   display a detailed view of each  term, including all  the information from part B1

      3.  Provide the interface that allows the user to access and edit all  the following details for each course:

            •   course title

            •   start and anticipated end dates (use a DatePicker)

            •   course status (e.g., in progress, completed, dropped, plan to take) (use a Picker)

            •   the course instructor’s name, phone number, and email address
            - include validation to prevent the user from saving a null value (e.g., an invalid email address)

      4.  Create features that allow the user to do all  the following for each course:

            •   add two assessments: one performance assessment and one objective assessment

            •   add and display optional notes

            •   enter, edit, and delete course information

            •   display an editable detailed view of the course, including the due date

            •   set alerts (e.g., notifications) for the start and end date of the course

            •   share notes via a sharing feature (e.g., email, SMS)

      5.  Provide an interface for the user to do all  the following for each  assessment:

            •   include the names and due dates

            •   enter, edit, and delete assessment information

            •   set notifications for anticipated due dates
   
      6.  Write code to create a set of data for evaluation purposes, including one term and one course from part B3, and include the two assessments from part B4 for that course.
